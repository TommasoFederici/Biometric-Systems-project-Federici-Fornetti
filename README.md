# Biometric-Systems-project-Federici-Fornetti-2025
Gender and age classification systems. Project for "Biometric systems" course at "Sapienza Universit√† di Roma". 

- Group members: Federici Tommaso, Lucia Fornetti

## Age and Gender Recognition 
We developed two architectures for the Age and Gender classification tasks.  

### Architecture 1
The first architecture is a multitask model obtained through the fine-tuning technique, using Google's FaceNet as the base model. The UTKFace dataset was used for retraining.  
The repository includes training and testing files for this architecture and a demo that shows how the architecture works.

### Architecture 2  
The second architecture combines two single-task models, both based on the CaffeNet model.  
This architecture is an adaptation of an existing project ([https://github.com/MohammedNayeem9/Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-OpenCV-in-Python](https://github.com/MohammedNayeem9/Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-OpenCV-in-Python)), which uses CaffeNet networks for age and gender detection. The repository includes a testing file and below there is the link to the google drive folder containg the file to upload the models.  

### Models:
Link to the drive containg all the models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B7CdAvMD1SOc_C_a3bgjrfsugmB9ZClx?usp=drive_link).

### Testing  
The UTKFace dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets with percentages of 70%, 10%, and 20% respectively. Both models were tested on the same test set using different metrics for each task. The results can be found in the project report.
